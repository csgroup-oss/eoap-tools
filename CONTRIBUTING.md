# Contributing

<!-- --8<-- [start:header] -->

First off, thanks for wanting to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

We appreciate your contributions and engagement. Even if you don't know how to code,
contributions are not always about coding. Everyone can help in their own way,
by reporting typos, or improving the documentation for example. Every bug report,
suggestion, and discussion helps improve the project.

The following elements will allow you to contribute, with a little guide to learn how
to make an approved contribution. Don't hesitate to share some new ideas to improve it!

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

We recommend a Linux-based distribution. You will need the following tools on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): version control system.
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): utility mandatory to run
  the `make` command, that we use for shortcuts of most-used commands
  in the project life-cycle.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (â‰¥3.12): language of the project,
  you'll need the interpreter.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (â‰¥0.5.0): package and project manager for Python.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csgroup-oss/eoap-tools.git
```

### Environment setup

List available commands:

```bash
make help
```

To setup your development environment run `make setup`.

Here's what it does:

- `uv sync`: create an isolated Python virtual environment,
  install the project in editable mode, synchronize project dependencies,
  and also install `dev` dependency group.
- `pre-commit install --install-hooks`: install pre-commit hooks. Learn more [here](#hooks).

This project uses multiple tools for its development, and your virtual environment
created with the previous command is just here to give you a working development environment.
Some tools are handled in sub-virtual environments created by [Tox](https://tox.wiki),
a virtual env manager and automation tool. The `install-dev` only gives you the
tools that you will be directly using, delegating other installations inside of _Tox_
virtual envs.

## How to contribute?

### Organization

#### Reporting issues

Traceability is necessary for a healthy development environment. Each
bug encountered must be reported by the creation of a new issue. Details
on how to reproduce it must be provided, and if possible visuals
(screenshots) are welcome.

Open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/csgroup-oss/eoap-tools/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
for issues that you encountered, if it's not already present in the issue tracker.

Before Submitting an Issue:

- **Check Existing Issues**: Your question or bug may already be reported.
- **Search the Documentation**: Ensure the answer isnâ€™t already covered.

#### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea to improve the project, we would love to hear it!
Please create a [Feature Request](https://github.com/csgroup-oss/eoap-tools/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
if something comes to your mind.

#### Working on issues

You can work on every open issue. Keep in mind to reference them in your
commits and pull requests, by following the [GitHub autolink convention](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests).

1. **Fork the Repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on the repository page.
2. **Clone the Fork** to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csgroup-oss/eoap-tools.git
   cd eoap-tools
   ```

3. **Follow the [Getting started](#getting-started) section** for project setup.
4. **Create a new branch** to work on.
   Check our [branch naming convention](#branches).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b (fix-or-feat)/your-topic-name
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a clear and concise commit message.
   Check our [commit convention](#commit).
6. **Push your changes** to your fork.

   ```bash
   git push origin (fix-or-feat)/your-topic-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Requests** from your fork's branch to the main repository's main
   branch. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes and the problem
   they address.

   Please follow these guidelines:

   - Use a clear and descriptive title.
   - Include every relevant issue number in the body, not in the title.
   - Give a complete description of every change made in the body.

### Writing code

#### References

Writing clean code is very important for a project. We read way more code than we write,
readable code is not a luxury, it is a necessity.

Let us be reminded of the Zen of Python, by Tim Peters:

```text
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

You are not alone for this difficult task. In the next sections you will
find about our QA tools.

#### Quality Assurance

##### Lint

To ensure good code writing, we use a lot the following lint tools:

- [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/): an extremely fast Python linter and formatter,
  written in Rust. Compatible with `black` formatting style, implement for
  linting `pylint`, `bandit`, `isort`, `pyupgrade`, `eradicate`, and
  `flake8` with dozens of its plugins. Check the configuration
  in our `pyproject.toml`.
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io): static type checker.

These tools are run with:

```bash
make lint
```

You can use `lint-watch` to run these tool on file change in `src/`. This
is really useful as it gives you instantaneous feedback on your code.

> Note: All of these are also run for each commit, failing the commit
> if at least one error is found.

##### Tests

We shall always aim for the highest code coverage in our tests, and our
development environment should use tools that will help us ensure it.

The test frameworks used are unittest and pytest, run with tox. Thanks
to pytest-cov, code coverage is evaluated and fails under 80% of test
coverage.

Run the tests with:

```bash
make test
```

##### Documentation

Doing features is great, but it is useless if nobody knows how to use
them. Keeping a clean, up-to-date documentation is of high priority.

This project is documented with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
The documentation source can be found in the `docs/src` folder.

You can build the docs with:

```bash
make docs
```

If you want to build the docs, and serve it with an http server after
the build:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

When writing the docs, use the live server to automatically rebuild the
docs.

```bash
make docs-live
```

##### Security

We use [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) in our CI to check
our Python dependencies for potential security vulnerabilities.

#### Release

You can create a release with `make release`. Because we follow a
[commit convention](#commit), the next version is guessed from
the commit history. The `CHANGELOG.md` file is generated automatically too.

Don't forget to push the tags to your origin repo!

```bash
git push --tags
```

### Git

#### Hooks

We use [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run tools at specific
moments of the Git workflow, with [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks).
It will mostly run linting and formatting tools on the source code in our case.
Some tools will also run for yaml, json, or markdown files etc... The commitizen
tool will also enforce conventional commit usage, that will be discussed in
the [Commit](#commit) section.

To activate our Git Hooks, please run the following commands:

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

Our hooks needs the following dependencies:

- Python (â‰¥3.12)
- pre-commit (â‰¥4.0)

#### Pull

It is good practice to pull with rebase over a normal pull.

```bash
git switch <your-branch>

# classic
git pull

# much better
git pull --rebase
```

But do keep in mind that to be able to rebase, you'll need to have a
clean state of your repository, with no changes to commit. If that's not
the case, you can use `stash` in addition:

```bash
git switch <your-branch>
git stash
git pull --rebase
git stash pop
```

If you don't want to specify `--rebase` each time you pull, configure it:

```bash
git config --local pull.rebase true
```

And if you don't want to manually `stash` at each rebase, you can also
configure it:

```bash
git config --local rebase.autostash true
```

Now each `git pull` will use `--rebase` and automatically `stash`!

#### Branches

Here's our branch naming convention:

- Protected branches:
  - `main`: our main branch, must have no error.
- Work branches:
  - `<scope>/<short-name>`: you work here.

List of scopes:

- **fix**: fix a bug
- **feat**: add a feature
- **docs**: documentation changes
- **refactor**: code refactoring

Those are examples, if you come up with other scopes, you can use them.
You can also use a scope from our commit convention as a branch scope.

We will prefer the use of "-" over "\_".

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/sanitize-paths
```

Don't forget to delete your local branches when you don't need them
anymore.

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

To keep your local refs to remote branches clean, use:

```bash
git remote prune origin
```

Here's one process that you can follow once your local branch was
pushed, successfully merged into `main`, and if you don't need it
anymore:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git branch -d <my-branch>
git remote prune origin
```

You can also use a scope from our commit convention as a branch scope.

#### Commit

Based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Summary :

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

The scope is optional, you can find a simpler form:

```text
<type>: <subject>
```

In order to be concise, type and scope should not be longer than 10
characters. Limit the first line to 70 characters or less.

##### Types

- **build:** Changes that affects the build system or external dependencies,
  such as adding a dependency, or modifying the build system.
- **bump:** version change, new release.
- **ci:** Changes in CI.
- **chore:** Changes which does not modify the code sources nor the tests.
- **docs:** Addition or modification of documentation/comment.
- **feat:** Adding or modifying a feature.
- **fix:** Bug fix.
- **perf:** Code change that improves performance.
- **refactor:** Code change that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature.
- **revert:** Rollback changes from a previous commit.
- **style:** Changes that does not affect the sense/meaning of the
  code (space, formatting, semicolon, newline, etc...).
- **test:** Addition of missing tests or correction of existing tests.

##### Scopes

This part is optional, it can be used to define more precisely what is
impacted. Examples:

```text
build(wheel): add x to the wheel
refactor(modulename): change x in y class
```

##### Subject

This is the content of your commit message. Please follow these rules:

- It starts with a lowercase letter.
- It does not end with a point.
- It must be conjugated in the imperative.
- The message should explain the what and the why, but not how.

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): message"
```

If you need a longer message, you can add a "body" to the commit.

```bash
git commit
```

Git then opens an editor to write the commit.

```text
type(scope): message

I am the body of the commit and I am not limited in size.
However, keep in mind that if the commit needs a large description it may be better to have an issue with it.
```
